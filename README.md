# Consumer-Complaint-Content-Classification-NLP
## Introduction:
In the world of consumer finance, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is dealing with a huge numbers of complaints every day. This flood of various complaints has made it crucial to create a application that can handle them all automatically. The objective of this project is to develop and implement a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to categorize consumer complaints effectively and expeditiously, thereby alleviating the manual burden faced by the CFPB.

## NLP Task:
Consumer complaint narratives serve as inputs, and the model classifies them into five consolidated product classes: Credit Reporting, Debt Collection, Mortgages and Loans, Credit Cards, and Retail Banking.

## Data Set:
The data set includes a decade of submissions made by consumers from December 2011 to October 2023 and it contains about 4,208,806 complaints data.
The filtered csv file contains the filtered and balanced dataset and it contains about (600K) data.
